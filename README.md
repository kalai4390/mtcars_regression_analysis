# mtcars_regression_analysis

mtcars dataset contains a collection of data compiled for 32 cars analyzed among 11 parameters. The following two questions are taken up for analysis in this work. 

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for efficent fuel consumption </b>
2. Quantifying the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

First, exploratory data analysis is performed to analyse and understand the data. Then, regression models are used to determine the relationship and correlation among the measured parameters in the dataset. Regression analysis is done by including and excluding different parameters contained in the dataset. 

The main objective is to infer how mpg is affected by manual and automatic transmission. An analysis is also performed to measure the influence of other parameters present in the dataset using regression analysis.
